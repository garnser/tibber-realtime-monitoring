# Tibber Realtime Monitoring (running on OKD)

This project give you the knowledge on how to create a simple application that visualize your power consumption (and costs if you have tibber). All work here is open source a free to use and distribute. Your only requirement is an modern electricy meter with tibber pulse plugged in to it.

**Discalimer:** This project intention is to showcase OKD features. It's not to be seen as a best practice for developing or deploying cloud native applications. 

## Architecture (orginal single node/docker deployment)
The original application (which can be found in the main branch) is a python script that communicates with the tibber api and writes its data to an influxdb time series database. In addition to the main application, thee are two python scripts that runs as cron jobs. These cronjobs fetch cost and weather data from the tibber and weathermap API. InfluxDB is configured as a datasource to grafan and the collected data is visual in a grafa dashbaord.

All components run on a single machine. Docker is used for influxdb and grafana. The python scripts are dependent on hardcoded unique values, such as access tokens and location data.

## Task: Refactor to run in kubernetes with help of OKD

All resources are configured in a specific project (namespace)

Create the project (namespace) in OKD:

``` 
oc new-project openinfra
```

If you run openstack with cinder, create a storage class that use cinder for persistent storage:

```
oc create -f manifests/sc.yaml
```

### influxdb
Influxdb is deployed from the official container image available at dockerhub.io. Variables to initiate the automated setup are provided in accordance with the official [documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb).

When you use the oc new-app command to create an application, it will also create all nessecary kubernetes resource to make in an application! 

```
oc new-app influxdb:latest -e DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=setup -e DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_USERNAME=tibber  -e DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD=tibber123 -e DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ORG=tibber -e DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_BUCKET=tibber -n openinfra
```

Optional, if you create the storage class earlier, create pvc:s for persisting the influxdb's data
```
oc create -f manifests/influxdb-pvc.yaml -n openinfra
oc patch deploy influxdb -n openinfra --type merge --patch-file manifests/influxdb-patch.js
```
### tibber application
Create the configmap and secret.

You will need an acces token for tibber and openweathremap:

- You can get your token from tibber [here](https://developer.tibber.com/)
- you can get a token for openweathermap [here](https://openweathermap.org/)

You can get the acccess token from influxdb from the influxdb pod:<br>
`oc exec $(oc get pods -o name | grep influxdb) -- influx auth list --user tibber --hide-headers  | cut -f 3)`

Replace the changeme value in the tibber-secret manifest to contain your access tokens.

Create the resources
```
oc apply -f manifests/tibber-configmap.yaml -n openinfra
oc apply -f manifests/tibber-secret.yaml -n openinfra
```

Update your tibber application with the values from the configmap and secret:
```
oc set env deploy tibber --from secret/tibber-secret -n openinfra
oc set env deploy tibber --from configmap/tibber-config -n openinfra
```
### tibber cronjobs
You need to create container images for the python code that should run as a kubernetes cronjob. This is also done with the tools available to you in OKD.

```
oc new-build python:3.9-ubi8~https://github.com/garnser/tibber-realtime-monitoring.git#openshift --name currentprice --context-dir python-apps/currentprice
oc new-build python:3.9-ubi8~https://github.com/garnser/tibber-realtime-monitoring.git#openshift --name weather --context-dir python-apps/weather
```

You can track the process and output from the build by looking in the buildconfig log. For example the weather application build can be tracked with the command Ã²c logs -f bc/weather -n openinfra`

When the build is complete. It pushes the container image to the openshift registry. You should se your container images by executing `oc get is -n openinfra`

Update the image value in the cronjob manifest with the values from the output oc `oc get is -n openinfra`

```yaml
...
            image: changeme
...
```
to
```yaml
            image: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openinfra/weather
```
and 
```yaml
            image: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openinfra/currentprice
```

Create the cronjob by applying the manifests

```
oc apply -f manifests/currentprice-cronjob.yaml -n openinfra
oc apply -f manifests/weather-cronjob.yaml -n openinfra
```

### grafana
grafana is installed using the grafana operator. You need to install the operator from the operatorhub. In the administrator console, navigate to Operators -> OperatorHub and search for "grafana". Install the operator to the opeinfra namespace.

When the operator has finished installing. Create the grafana resources, Grafana, GrafanaDataSource and grafana Dashboard by applying the manifests.

First, verify successfull installation of the operator:

`oc get csv -n openinfra | grep grafana`

It should return an output similar to:<br>
`grafana-operator.v4.2.0            Grafana Operator   4.2.0     grafana-operator.v4.1.1            Succeeded`

Once succeded, create the resources
```
oc create -f manifests/tibber-grafanas.yaml -n openinfra
oc create -f manifests/tibber-grafanadatasources.yaml -n openinfra
oc create -f manifests/tibber-grafanadashboard.yaml -n openinfra
```
Get the external route for your application

`oc get route grafana-route -o jsonpath='{.status.ingress[].host}'`

Use a web broser to access it and view your consumption and cost data.
